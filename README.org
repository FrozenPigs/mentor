* mentor

mentor is a GNU Emacs frontend for the [[http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/][rTorrent]] bittorrent client, using XML-RPC.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users. Key bindings are chosen to
be as close to the vanilla rtorrent curses interface as possible.

You can find the latest version of mentor here:

** Quick Start

Clone the repository using:

: git clone https://github.com/skangas/mentor.git

Add this to your ~/.emacs:

 : (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/mentor/")
 : (require 'mentor)
 : (setq mentor-rtorrent-url "scgi://localhost:5000")
   
Change "~/src/mentor" to the path where you keep the mentor source code.

Add this to your ~/.rtorrent.rc:
   
 : scgi_port = 127.0.0.1:5000
 : xmlrpc_dialect = i8
 : encoding_list = UTF-8
   
Make sure `scgi_port' matches `mentor-rtorrent-url' above.

Restart both rTorrent and Emacs (or just make sure mentor is loaded).

To start mentor, run:

 : M-x mentor

** Additional configuration

You can find Mentor in the `External' customize group.

 : M-x customize

** Configuring rtorrent

For more information on configuring rTorrent, refer to:
   
http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide

** Known issues

- There is currently no support (patches welcome) for communicating with
  rtorrent over a local socket using the more secure scgi_local command. This
  means it is currently not advisable to use mentor on anything but single user
  systems.

- mentor currently has some performance issues if you have many (several
  hundreds) torrents. Be aware.

** Misc

- If you wish to byte-compile mentor, go into the source directory and run:

  : make

- Here is how you setup autoload. See the Emacs manual for more information on
  this.

  : (autoload 'mentor "mentor" nil t)
