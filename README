This is a GNU Emacs frontend for the rTorrent bittorrent client, using XML-RPC.

This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users. Key bindings are chosen to
be as close to the vanilla rtorrent curses interface as possible.

You can find the latest version of mentor here:

* Quick Start

1. Add this to your ~/.emacs

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/mentor/")
    (require 'mentor)
    (setq mentor-rtorrent-url "scgi://localhost:5000")

Change "~/src/mentor" to the path where you keep the mentor source code.

2. Configure rtorrent for scgi

Add this to your ~/.rtorrent.rc

    scgi_port = 127.0.0.1:5000
    xmlrpc_dialect = i8
    encoding_list = UTF-8

Make sure `scgi_port' matches `mentor-rtorrent-url' above.

There is currently no support for communicating with rtorrent over a local
socket using the more secure scgi_local command. (Patches welcome...) This means
it is currently not advisable to use mentor on anything but single user systems.

For more information on configuring rTorrent, refer to:

http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide

3. Additional configuration:

    M-x customize

You can find Mentor in the External group.

4. To start mentor, run:

    M-x mentor

* Performance

mentor currently has some performance issues, especially if you have many
torrents. Be aware.

If you wish to byte-compile mentor, go into the source directory and write:

    make

Here is how you setup autoload. See the Emacs manual for more information on
this.

    (autoload 'mentor "mentor" nil t)
